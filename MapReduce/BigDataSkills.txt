Hadoop is a programming framework based on Java that offers a distributed file system and helps organizations process big data sets.
Hadoop makes it possible to run applications on systems with thousands of commodity hardware nodes, and to handle thousands of terabytes of data. Its distributed file system facilitates rapid data transfer rates among nodes and allows the system to continue operating in case of a node failure. This approach lowers the risk of catastrophic system failure and unexpected data loss, even if a significant number of nodes become inoperative. Consequently, Hadoop quickly emerged as a foundation for big data processing tasks, such as scientific analytics, business and sales planning, and processing enormous volumes of sensor data, including from internet of things sensors.
Since its initial release, Hadoop has been continuously developed and updated. The second iteration of Hadoop (Hadoop 2) improved resource management and scheduling. 
Organizations can deploy Hadoop components and supporting software packages in their local data center. However, most big data projects depend on short-term use of substantial computing resources. T
